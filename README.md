### Brief Description

With Boundless Tokens, users can acquire NFTs from a curated list from the Starknet ecosystem and transform them into token-bound accounts as well as associating them with specific tokens or NFTs. These accounts can have unique features, permissions, and behaviors based on the tokens they hold. For example, an account bound to a governance token may have voting rights, while an account bound to an NFT could grant access to exclusive content or experiences.
