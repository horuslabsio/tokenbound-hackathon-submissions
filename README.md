Unix Tokenbound Multi-Chain manager

### Brief Description

Unix is a decentralized application designed to streamline the management and tracking of token-bound accounts across multiple blockchain networks, offering a comprehensive multi-chain solution. By utilizing Unix, users can efficiently oversee all their token-bound accounts, perform token swaps, create new token-bound accounts, and bridge tokens across various chains. Unix simplifies the complexities of managing multiple token-bound accounts within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and governance systems by providing a unified platform. Key features include a single interface for account management across different chains, support for all types of token swaps, seamless creation of token-bound accounts, and efficient token bridging. This unification not only enhances efficiency but also minimizes errors, ultimately saving users time and effort.
